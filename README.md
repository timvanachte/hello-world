Hello world!

Don't let the age of my account (Est. 2013) fool you. This is the first time I'm experimenting with Github. I have been learning and using Git for web application development since then though (I was mostly deploying to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon CodeCommit production environment), but never did I include Github, shame on me! Now that I decided to fully dive into open source, I am setting up my Github account decently as it should be ;-)

I'll test a new commit in a minute, adding my LinkedIn profile information.
