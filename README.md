# hello-world

Hello world!

Don't let the age of my account (Est. 2013) fool you. This is the first time I'm experimenting with Github. I have been learning and using Git for web application development since then though (I was mostly deploying to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon CodeCommit production environment), but never did I include Github, shame on me! Now that I decided to fully dive into open source, I am setting up my Github account decently as it should be ;-)

## Background information

Here is some more background information on projects I'm involved in:

Hi, I’m involved in EU projects for Digipolis Ghent. As Partnership Lead in the Foresight Team, and in close partnership with the City of Ghent, we’re specializing in understanding and influencing the impact/opportunities of future govtech on everyone and everything in the city. Together, we induce innovation in the city so citizens can get smarter in our “Wise City of People”. One of the international smart city projects I'm involved in is @SCORE_NSR (Smart Cities + Open data REuse).

I'm also active as advisor-developer-researcher on the topic of Crisis Intelligence. In this domain I was project member of E2mC, a now finished H2020 EU project on social media analysis, crowdsourcing and Copernicus satellite imagery @E2mC_H2020. I am also volunteer member of #TeamD5, an award winning 24/7 crisis communications support team set up by Belgium's federal government.

In the crisis world, my main specialty is social media & tools in crisis and emergency management. I’m providing crisis support as part of the team at the firm PM Risk•Crisis•Change @PM_crisis (give them a call to make your organization crisis prepared). As a developer I coordinate the technical side of the innovative crisis simulation platform #CIPSimulator which is used all over the world by various firms, organisations and governments to train crisis teams. I also helped to develop PM's Zombie Crisis Game, a combination of a teambuilding event, board game and crisis simulation, backed both by science and years of actual crisis experience, and probably the weirdest crisis exercise you will ever experience ;-)

Furthermore I am co-founder of the international CIP Institute @cipinst, and last but not least I am also involved in a fifties retro fashion store in Ghent, Belgium @funniretro

I love to be involved in meaningful collaboration between totally different worlds around technology. A recurring theme of my activities – and something that fascinates me – is how powerful a strong human & tech synergy can be. Humans need machines and machines need humans. So always feel free to contact me, human, cyborg or whatever creature from the future! ;-)
